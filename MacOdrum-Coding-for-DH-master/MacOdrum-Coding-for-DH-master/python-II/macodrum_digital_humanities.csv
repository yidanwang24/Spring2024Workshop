Digital humanities—A discipline in its own right? An analysis of the role and position of digital humanities in the academic landscape,"Luhmann, Jan ;  Burghardt, Manuel","Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 2022-02, Vol.73 (2), p.148-171",,"Computer Science ;  Computer Science, Information Systems ;  Information Science & Library Science ;  Science & Technology ;  Technology",,,"Although digital humanities (DH) has received a lot of attention in recent years, its status as “a discipline in its own right” (Schreibman et al., A companion to digital humanities (pp. xxiii–xxvii). Blackwell; 2004) and its position in the overall academic landscape are still being negotiated. While there are countless essays and opinion pieces that debate the status of DH, little research has been dedicated to exploring the field in a systematic and empirical way (Poole, Journal of Documentation; 2017:73). This study aims to contribute to the existing research gap by comparing articles published over the past three decades in three established English‐language DH journals (Computers and the Humanities, Literary and Linguistic Computing, Digital Humanities Quarterly) with research articles from journals in 15 other academic disciplines (corpus size: 34,041 articles; 299 million tokens). As a method of analysis, we use latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling, combined with recent approaches that aggregate topic models by means of hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Our findings indicate that DH is simultaneously a discipline in its own right and a highly interdisciplinary field, with many connecting factors to neighboring disciplines—first and foremost, computational linguistics, and information science. Detailed descriptive analyses shed some light on the diachronic development of DH and also highlight topics that are characteristic for DH.",,,,ISSN: 2330-1635; EISSN: 2330-1643; DOI: 10.1002/asi.24533,,,"Hoboken, USA: John Wiley & Sons, Inc",,,,,,,"Wiley Online Library; Scopus; Business Source Complete; Science Citation Index Expanded<img src=""https://exlibris-pub.s3.amazonaws.com/fromwos-v2.jpg"" />; Social Sciences Citation Index<img src=""https://exlibris-pub.s3.amazonaws.com/fromwos-v2.jpg"" />",,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1002_asi_24533

Through a survey of iSchool programs and an online DH course registry, we investigate the various education models for DH training found in iSchools, followed by a detailed look at DH courses and curricula, explored through analysis of course syllabi and course descriptions. We take a brief look at collaborative disciplines with which iSchools cooperate on DH research projects or in offering DH education. Next, we explore DH careers through an analysis of relevant job advertisements.

Therefore, we classify the observed papers according to a taxonomy of text analysis tasks, categorize applied close and distant reading techniques to support the investigation of these tasks and illustrate approaches that combine both reading techniques in order to provide a multi‐faceted view of the textual data.

It examines the distribution of research outputs and languages, identifies the active journals and institutions, dissects the network of categories and cited references, and interprets the hot research topics.
Design/methodology/approach - The source data are derived from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection. To reveal the holistic landscape of this field, VOSviewer and CiteSpace as popular visualization tools are employed to process the bibliographic data including author, category, reference, and keyword. Furthermore, the parameter design of the visualization tools follows the general procedures and methods for bibliometric analysis.
Findings - There is an obviously rapid growth in digital humanities research. English is still the leading academic language in this field. The most influential authors all come from or have scientific relationships with Europe and North America, and two leading countries of which are the UK and USA. Digital humanities is the result of a dynamic dialogue between humanistic exploration and digital means. This research field is closely associated with history, literary and cultural heritage, and information and library science.
Research limitations/implications - This analysis relies on the metadata information extracted from the WoS database; however, some valuable literatures in the field of digital humanities may not be retrieved from the database owing to the inherent challenge of topic search. This study is also restricted by the scope of publications, the limitation regarding the source of data is that WoS database may have underrepresented publications in this domain.
Originality/value - The output of this paper could be a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners interesting in the knowledge domain of digital humanities. Moreover, the conclusions of this retrospective analysis can be deemed as the comparable foundation for future study.",,,,ISSN: 0022-0418; EISSN: 1758-7379; DOI: 10.1108/JD-05-2017-0076,,,BINGLEY: Emerald Group Publishing,,,,,,,"Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA); Computer Science Database; Scholars Portal Journals: Emerald Management 150 Collection; Emerald Management 120; Scopus; Advanced Technologies & Aerospace Collection; Scholars Portal Journals: Emerald Management 120 Collection; Arts & Humanities Database; Art, Design & Architecture Collection (Proquest) (PQ_SDU_P3); Social Sciences Citation Index<img src=""https://exlibris-pub.s3.amazonaws.com/fromwos-v2.jpg"" />; Scholars Portal Journals: Emerald",,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1108_JD_05_2017_0076

While humanists are accustomed to handling such uncertainty with their established methods, they are cautious of visualizations that appear overly objective and fail to communicate this uncertainty. To design more trustworthy visualizations for humanistic research, therefore, a deeper understanding of its relation to uncertainty is needed. We systematically reviewed 126 publications from digital humanities literature that use visualization as part of their research process, and examined how uncertainty was handled and represented in their visualizations. Crossing these dimensions with the visualization type and use, we identified that uncertainty originated from multiple steps in the research process from the source artifacts to their datafication. We also noted how besides known uncertainty coping strategies, such as excluding data and evaluating its effects, humanists also embraced uncertainty as a separate dimension important to retain. By mapping how the visualizations encoded uncertainty, we identified four approaches that varied in terms of explicitness and customization. This work contributes with two empirical taxonomies of uncertainty and it's corresponding coping strategies, as well as with the foundation of a research agenda for uncertainty visualization in the digital humanities. Our findings further the synergy among humanists and visualization researchers, and ultimately contribute to the development of more trustworthy, uncertainty-aware visualizations.",,,,ISSN: 1077-2626; EISSN: 1941-0506; DOI: 10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209436; PMID: 36166561; CODEN: ITVGEA,,,United States: IEEE,,,,,,,IEEE/IET Electronic Library (IEL),,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_scopus_primary_2_s2_0_85139484761

Replicating the human ability to connect Vision and Language has recently been gaining a lot of attention in the Computer Vision and the Natural Language Processing communities. This research effort has resulted in algorithms that can retrieve images from textual descriptions and vice versa, when realistic images and sentences with simple semantics are employed and when paired training data is provided. In this paper, we go beyond these limitations and tackle the design of visual-semantic algorithms in the domain of the Digital Humanities. This setting not only advertises more complex visual and semantic structures but also features a significant lack of training data which makes the use of fully-supervised approaches infeasible. With this aim, we propose a joint visual-semantic embedding that can automatically align illustrations and textual elements without paired supervision. This is achieved by transferring the knowledge learned on ordinary visual-semantic datasets to the artistic domain. Experiments, performed on two datasets specifically designed for this domain, validate the proposed strategies and quantify the domain shift between natural images and artworks.",,,,ISSN: 0167-8655; EISSN: 1872-7344; DOI: 10.1016/j.patrec.2019.11.018,,,AMSTERDAM: Elsevier B.V,,,,,,,"Scholars Portal Journals: Elsevier Backfile: Decision Sciences; Scopus; Scholars Portal Journals: Elsevier Backfile: Computer Science; Scholars Portal Journals: Elsevier Current; ScienceDirect Journals; Science Citation Index Expanded<img src=""https://exlibris-pub.s3.amazonaws.com/fromwos-v2.jpg"" />",,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_proquest_journals_2352369015

The purpose of this paper is to dissect key issues and debates in digital humanities, an emerging field of theory and practice. Digital humanities stands greatly to impact the Information and Library Science (ILS) professions (and vice versa) as well as the traditional humanities disciplines.
Design/methodology/approach
This paper explores the contours of digital humanities as a field, touching upon fundamental issues related to the field’s coalescence and thus to its structure and epistemology. It looks at the ways in which digital humanities brings new approaches and sheds new light on manifold humanities foci.
Findings
Digital humanities work represents a vital new current of interdisciplinary, collaborative intellectual activity both in- and outside the academy; it merits particular attention from ILS.
Research limitations/implications
This paper helps potential stakeholders understand the intellectual and practical framework of the digital humanities and “its relationship” to their own intellectual and professional work.
Originality/value
This paper critically synthesizes previous scholarly work in digital humanities. It has particular value for those in ILS, a community that has proven especially receptive to the field, as well as to scholars working in many humanities disciplines.

Inscription serves as a fundamental rhetorical device in research outputs and practices. As many inscriptions are deeply rooted in a scientific research paradigm, they can be used to evaluate the level of scientificity of a scientific field. This is specifically helpful to understand the relationships between research traditions in digital humanities (DH), a highly cross‐disciplinary between various humanities and scientific traditions. This paper presents a quantitative, community‐focused examination of how inscriptions are used in English‐language research articles in DH journals. We randomly selected 252 articles published between 2011 and 2020 from a representative DH journal list, and manually classified the inscriptions and author domains in these publications. We found that inscriptions have been increasingly used during the past decade, and their uses are more intensive in publications led by STEM authors comparing to other domains.

Text analysis using deep neural networks in digital humanities and information science,"Suissa, Omri ;  Elmalech, Avshalom ;  Zhitomirsky‐Geffet, Maayan","Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 2022-02, Vol.73 (2), p.268-287",,"Computer Science ;  Computer Science, Information Systems ;  Information Science & Library Science ;  Science & Technology ;  Technology",,,"Combining computational technologies and humanities is an ongoing effort aimed at making resources such as texts, images, audio, video, and other artifacts digitally available, searchable, and analyzable. In recent years, deep neural networks (DNN) dominate the field of automatic text analysis and natural language processing (NLP), in some cases presenting a super‐human performance. DNNs are the state‐of‐the‐art machine learning algorithms solving many NLP tasks that are relevant for Digital Humanities (DH) research, such as spell checking, language detection, entity extraction, author detection, question answering, and other tasks. These supervised algorithms learn patterns from a large number of “right” and “wrong” examples and apply them to new examples. However, using DNNs for analyzing the text resources in DH research presents two main challenges: (un)availability of training data and a need for domain adaptation. This paper explores these challenges by analyzing multiple use‐cases of DH studies in recent literature and their possible solutions and lays out a practical decision model for DH experts for when and how to choose the appropriate deep learning approaches for their research.

"Digital Humanities—Ways Forward; Future Challenges: Honoring David Kammerling Smith and the Digital Public Sphere; Acceleration?; Digital Humanities for the People(?); Infrastructure as Privilege; Computation, Cultures, and Communities; Digital Humanities and Generational Shift","Charnow, Sally Debra ;  Horn, Jeff ;  Ravel, Jeffrey S. ;  Ermus, Cindy ;  Wrisley, David Joseph ;  Pichichero, Christy ;  Smith, David Kammerling","Historical reflections, 2023-12, Vol.49 (3), p.1-55",,,,,"Abstract Have digital tools and methods accelerated the rate of scholarly production over the last 20 years? If so, has this acceleration been beneficial for scholarship? This article considers examples of accelerated historical scholarship as well as calls for a “slow history.” Through an analysis of the author's own experiences with the digital humanities, it examines the advantages and disadvantages of digital technologies in the field of history. It concludes that online resources and digital technologies have expanded the archive for the historian and created new ways to reach other specialists and the general public. Nevertheless, historical scholarship must still rely on carefully crafted, well-argued prose whose production cannot be accelerated by new digital technologies, although recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence may ultimately challenge this situation. In recent decades, the field (or, at times, discipline) of digital humanities (DH) has revolutionized the scholarly profession and beyond—and with good reason. Seen at times as a democratizing force, DH has led to the creation of an increasing number of open- access databases and scholarly publications, the launching of massive archival digitization initiatives, and the development of numerous digital tools that help streamline the work of the academic researcher, student, and educator. In many ways, then, its benefits are manifest. Yet, recent years have also begun to reveal numerous problems that could influence various aspects of our trade as well as what—and how—information will be available in the future. This article discusses some of the advantages and disadvantages of DH and invites the reader to reflect on what we can do to help mitigate these problems. Exciting new modes of digital scholarship have emerged in recent years, providing us with expanded windows onto the past. This process has been accelerated by somewhat democratized ways of digitizing and analyzing source material. A main issue of contemporary knowledge production using digitized sources is how power can so easily be reinscribed into access to archives. The choice to digitize collections, even the existence of collections themselves, creates a great opportunity for research but also runs the risk of reinforcing the privilege and worldviews that have shaped and continue to shape the very processes of digitization and digitalization. Drawing on examples of Western and non-Western digital scholarship, this article argues that, although the digital facilitates greater public knowledge of collections, when it comes to decolonizing our research subjects, it also introduces significant layers of complexity. This article advances an analysis of the development and state of critical digital humanities. It posits two modalities for this approach to digital humanities (DH). The first is a modality of inward-looking, functional self-critique that comprises a rethinking of computational genesis stories, logics and methods, institutions and infrastructures, and digital capitalism, and the second is an outward-looking critique best understood as a form of situated sociopolitical engagement that embraces epistemic and social justice projects that are decolonial, anti-racist, inclusive, collaborative, and multilingual. Through these analyses, the article offers a vision of critical digital humanities in its mission to critique the ideologies, social inequities, and epistemological hierarchies that are built into technological products and computational logics and that are concomitantly fostered by knowledge- creation industries of universities, corporations, governments, and the GLAM[R] sector. In this way, the article shows how critical digital humanities helps us to envision the role that DH can play in processes of recovery, reparations, emancipation, and community-building. Drawing upon over 20 years as Editor-in-Chief of H-France, I argue that the scholarly profession, established in Cold War era, pre-digital institutions, has only begun to adapt to the transformations introduced by the global digital humanities. A generational shift is currently underway as younger scholars more natively adept with digital technologies use their skills and forms of new media to press for changes in hiring and tenure practices, to demand greater progress on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) issues, and to insist that the academy confront the collapse of academic positions in the humanities and provide training for and recognition of alternative career paths. I call upon professional organizations to undertake difficult conversations and take leadership in reshaping professional organizations for a post–Cold War, digital age, especially in terms of funding priorities. Scholarly organizations will best gain influence through collaboration.",,,,ISSN: 0315-7997; EISSN: 1939-2419; DOI: 10.3167/hrrh.2023.490301,,,,,,,,,,Berghahn Journals,,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_crossref_primary_10_3167_hrrh_2023_490301

When assessing learning technologies, we have to consider the degree to which they complement the rhythms immanent to human thought, knowledge, investigation, and experimentation.In this paper, we examine learning from a humanities perspective, arguing that reading, writing, and thinking are ways of learning underscored by various genres of movement that segue with or diverge from the movements inherent to digital technologies, especially those deployed in learning systems. Using the work of thinkers such as John Dewey and Michel Serres, we examine the importance of movement in dialogue, where to truly learn involves embedding oneself in the flow of thought, accepting the flexibility of concepts, and aligning oneself with a community of thinkers.",,,,ISSN: 0039-3746; EISSN: 1573-191X; DOI: 10.1007/s11217-023-09912-5,,,DORDRECHT: Springer Nature,,,,,,,"SpringerLink Journals; Arts & Humanities Citation Index<img src=""https://exlibris-pub.s3.amazonaws.com/fromwos-v2.jpg"" />; Social Sciences Citation Index<img src=""https://exlibris-pub.s3.amazonaws.com/fromwos-v2.jpg"" />; Scholars Portal Journals: Springer",,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_webofscience_primary_001135991800001CitationCount

A Chinese ancient book digital humanities research platform to support digital humanities research,"Chen, Chih-Ming ;  Chang, Chung","Electronic library, 2019-06, Vol.37 (2), p.314-336",,"Academic libraries ;  Annotations ;  Archives & records ;  Archiving ;  Asian history ;  Automatic text annotation ;  Character social networks analysis ;  Chinese ancient books ;  Chinese history ;  Collaboration ;  Computer science ;  Data base management systems ;  Deeds ;  Digital archives ;  Digital humanities ;  Digital imaging ;  Digitization ;  Dynasties ;  Frequency distribution ;  Image segmentation ;  Information Science & Library Science ;  Information systems ;  Java (programming language) ;  Knowledge management ;  Librarians ;  Library collections ;  Manuscripts, Chinese ;  Network analysis ;  Platforms ;  R&D ;  Research & development ;  Researchers ;  Science & Technology ;  Social networks ;  Technology ;  Texts ;  User interface",,,"Purpose
With the rapid development of digital humanities, some digital humanities platforms have been successfully developed to support digital humanities research for humanists. However, most of them have still not provided a friendly digital reading environment and practicable social network analysis tool to support humanists on interpreting texts and exploring characters’ social network relationships. Moreover, the advancement of digitization technologies for the retrieval and use of Chinese ancient books is arising an unprecedented challenge and opportunity. For these reasons, this paper aims to present a Chinese ancient books digital humanities research platform (CABDHRP) to support historical China studies. In addition to providing digital archives, digital reading, basic search and advanced search functions for Chinese ancient books, this platform still provides two novel functions that can more effectively support digital humanities research, including an automatic text annotation system (ATAS) for interpreting texts and a character social network relationship map tool (CSNRMT) for exploring characters’ social network relationships.
Design/methodology/approach
This study adopted DSpace, an open-source institutional repository system, to serve as a digital archives system for archiving scanned images, metadata, and full texts to develop the CABDHRP for supporting digital humanities (DH) research. Moreover, the ATAS developed in the CABDHRP used the Node.js framework to implement the system’s front- and back-end services, as well as application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by different databases, such as China Biographical Database (CBDB) and TGAZ, used to retrieve the useful linked data (LD) sources for interpreting ancient texts. Also, Neo4j which is an open-source graph database management system was used to implement the CSNRMT of the CABDHRP. Finally, JavaScript and jQuery were applied to develop a monitoring program embedded in the CABDHRP to record the use processes from humanists based on xAPI (experience API). To understand the research participants’ perception when interpreting the historical texts and characters’ social network relationships with the support of ATAS and CSNRMT, semi-structured interviews with 21 research participants were conducted.
Findings
An ATAS embedded in the reading interface of CABDHRP can collect resources from different databases through LD for automatically annotating ancient texts to support digital humanities research. It allows the humanists to refer to resources from diverse databases when interpreting ancient texts, as well as provides a friendly text annotation reader for humanists to interpret ancient text through reading. Additionally, the CSNRMT provided by the CABDHRP can semi-automatically identify characters’ names based on Chinese word segmentation technology and humanists’ support to confirm and analyze characters’ social network relationships from Chinese ancient books based on visualizing characters’ social networks as a knowledge graph. The CABDHRP not only can stimulate humanists to explore new viewpoints in a humanistic research, but also can promote the public to emerge the learning interest and awareness of Chinese ancient books.
Originality/value
This study proposed a novel CABDHRP that provides the advanced features, including the automatic word segmentation of Chinese text, automatic Chinese text annotation, semi-automatic character social network analysis and user behavior analysis, that are different from other existed digital humanities platforms. Currently, there is no this kind of digital humanities platform developed for humanists to support digital humanities research.",,,,ISSN: 0264-0473; ISSN: 1758-616X; EISSN: 1758-616X; DOI: 10.1108/EL-10-2018-0213,,,BINGLEY: Emerald Publishing Limited,,,,,,,"Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA); Computer Science Database; Scholars Portal Journals: Emerald Management 150 Collection; Emerald Management 120; Scopus; Advanced Technologies & Aerospace Collection; Scholars Portal Journals: Emerald Management 120 Collection; Social Sciences Citation Index<img src=""https://exlibris-pub.s3.amazonaws.com/fromwos-v2.jpg"" />; Scholars Portal Journals: Emerald",,,,,,,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1108_EL_10_2018_0213
