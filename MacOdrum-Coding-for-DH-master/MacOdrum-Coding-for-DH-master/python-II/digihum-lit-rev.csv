This was a rather revolutionary idea compared to the traditional Close Reading, which focuses on the thorough interpretation of an individual work. Both reading techniques are the prior means of Visual Text Analysis. We present an overview of the research conducted since 2005 on supporting text analysis tasks with close and distant reading visualizations in the digital humanities. Therefore, we classify the observed papers according to a taxonomy of text analysis tasks, categorize applied close and distant reading techniques to support the investigation of these tasks and illustrate approaches that combine both reading techniques in order to provide a multi‐faceted view of the textual data. In addition, we take a look at the used text sources and at the typical data transformation steps required for the proposed visualizations. Finally, we summarize collaboration experiences when developing visualizations for close and distant reading, and we give an outlook on future challenges in that research area.

Distribution features and intellectual structures of digital humanities: A bibliometric analysis,"Wang, Qing","Journal of documentation, 2018-01-08, Vol.74 (1), p.223-246",,Author productivity ;  Bibliometrics ;  Cultural factors ;  Cultural resources ;  Databases ;  Design parameters ;  Digital humanities ;  Documents ;  Interdisciplinary aspects ;  Scientometrics ;  Visualization,,,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to conduct a retrospective bibliometric analysis of documents about digital humanities, an emerging but interdisciplinary movement. It examines the distribution of research outputs and languages, identifies the active journals and institutions, dissects the network of categories and cited references, and interprets the hot research topics. Design/methodology/approach The source data are derived from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection. To reveal the holistic landscape of this field, VOSviewer and CiteSpace as popular visualization tools are employed to process the bibliographic data including author, category, reference, and keyword. Furthermore, the parameter design of the visualization tools follows the general procedures and methods for bibliometric analysis. Findings There is an obviously rapid growth in digital humanities research. English is still the leading academic language in this field. The most influential authors all come from or have scientific relationships with Europe and North America, and two leading countries of which are the UK and USA. Digital humanities is the result of a dynamic dialogue between humanistic exploration and digital means. This research field is closely associated with history, literary and cultural heritage, and information and library science. Research limitations/implications This analysis relies on the metadata information extracted from the WoS database; however, some valuable literatures in the field of digital humanities may not be retrieved from the database owing to the inherent challenge of topic search. This study is also restricted by the scope of publications, the limitation regarding the source of data is that WoS database may have underrepresented publications in this domain. Originality/value The output of this paper could be a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners interesting in the knowledge domain of digital humanities. Moreover, the conclusions of this retrospective analysis can be deemed as the comparable foundation for future study.",,,,ISSN: 0022-0418; EISSN: 1758-7379; DOI: 10.1108/JD-05-2017-0076,,,Bradford: Emerald Group Publishing Limited,,,,,,,Computer Science Database,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_proquest_journals_1983632384

But what the word means is unclear. To define it precisely, two studies examined the American Psychological Association's system of controlled vocabulary—specifically, the 447 associated terms it presents—and used techniques from the Digital Humanities to identify 88 closely related concepts and six broad conceptual clusters. The resulting analyses show how similar ideas are interrelated: self-control, self-management, self-observation, learning, social behavior, and the personality constructs related to self-monitoring. A full-color network map locates these concepts and clusters relative to each other. It also highlights some of the interests of different audiences, which can be described heuristically using two axes that have been labeled abstract versus practical and self-oriented versus other-oriented.",,,,ISSN: 0009-3920; EISSN: 1467-8624; DOI: 10.1111/cdev.12395; PMID: 26234744,,,United States: Blackwell Publishing Ltd,,,,,,,Wiley-Blackwell Full Collection - CRKN; MEDLINE; Scholars Portal Journals: Wiley; JSTOR Arts & Sciences IV; PubMed,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_1711546174

We identify two major developments that seem to be taking place within DH, with a specific focus on the infrastructural aspects of the development: (1) a strive to open up and broaden the research output and (2) multi-disciplinary collaboration and its effects. The two major components accentuate the new infrastructural patterns that are developing and the challenges these infer on universities. While current research is at large multi-disciplinary, developing infrastructures also enable the move towards post-disciplinarity, bringing the universities closer to the surrounding society. At five universities in Sweden, individual-sited infrastructures supporting DH research have been built today. They are complemented by national and international infrastructures, thus supporting developments and tackling some of the major challenges. In the article, the relations between individual disciplines, the question of multi- and post-disciplinarity, and the field of Digital Humanities are discussed, while stressing the factors necessary—sine qua non—for a fruitful development of the scholarly infrastructures.",,,,ISSN: 2055-7671; ISSN: 2055-768X; EISSN: 2055-768X; DOI: 10.1093/llc/fqz042,,,,,,,,,,Oxford Journals - CRKN,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_swepub_primary_oai_lup_lub_lu_se_1b76d1a9_36ff_4440_bd79_21d5b023c287

Drawing on Sianne Ngai’s theorization of “ugly feelings” and using his own experience with digital humanities instruction as a case study, the author offers ways to center emotional work, especially work involving frustration and anxiety, in the classroom. Asking students to develop failed prototypes and reflect on the process, for example, can provide them with a better sense of what it might mean to succeed. Giving the same exercise twice, with artificially imposed difficulties the second time, might help them learn concrete steps for working through mounting irritation. In short, frustration and anxiety are not things that emerge from time to time—they are ever-present. The author argues that it is the job of instructors to develop ways to prepare students not for the unexpected failure but for the inevitable frustration that comes even with success.",,,,ISSN: 1531-4200; EISSN: 1533-6255; DOI: 10.1215/15314200-7615485,,,Duke University Press,,,,,,,Project MUSE - Premium Collection; e-Duke Journals Scholarly Collection: Expanded,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_projectmuse_journals_733102_S1533625519300100

The promise of digital humanities pedagogy: Decolonizing a diverse classroom in Ghana,"Hallberg Adu, Kajsa","Digital Scholarship in the Humanities, 2021-06-25, Vol.36 (Supplement_1), p.i37-i42",,,,,"Abstract Higher education operates in a quickly changing, progressively more globalized, cosmopolitan, and interconnected world (Bauman, 2000, Globalization: The Human Consequences.

For our students, the future leaders of this unequal world, critical reasoning becomes a key skill, and perhaps especially so for students in the Global South. This paper argues that digital humanities (DH) can provide both a theoretical framework for decolonizing the academy and technological solutions to hurdles in this process.

The first, a documentary edition of personal papers held by Peter Still, a former slave, was conceived as an independent research project involving the participation of two undergraduate research assistants; the second, based upon letters to and from the Rutgers College War Service Bureau (1917–1919), has been designed as a two-week text encoding unit in a proposed undergraduate course on data and culture. These two projects, both featuring the letter as their object of study, are compared and contrasted as models of data and process, affording reflections on the overlapping concerns of the library instruction and digital humanities communities of practice. I propose viewing text encoding projects, particularly those that focus on lesser known creators or on life documents such as letters, as a means of accessing both critical library pedagogy and digital humanities methodology. By developing such projects, librarians address a number of collection and instruction related objectives of the library, while offering a valuable introduction to a set of methods that are of increasing importance to undergraduate education. Furthermore, these projects may be conducted at smaller scales, by reusing and adapting methods and software shared by the digital humanities community, thereby limiting reliance on institutional partners for technology and infrastructure support, which may not be forthcoming in under-resourced institutional contexts.",,,,ISSN: 0099-1333; EISSN: 1879-1999; DOI: 10.1016/j.acalib.2019.05.001,,,Elsevier Inc,,,,,,,Scholars Portal Journals: Elsevier; Elsevier Additional Journals - CRKN,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1016_j_acalib_2019_05_001

The discourse and practice put forward a very explicit imagination of a connected subject that is also naturalized in digital humanities. The intended beneficiary is posited as ""to be connected,"" entering a curative cycle of literacy and access intended to reform this subject. This paper proposes a subject of ""disconnectivity,"" which needs to be introduced into this debate. In the face of Internet blackouts and online bans, there is a subject who gets disconnected when it has potential for dissent or critique. Drawing from 1000 responses gathered in the wake of a political agitation in the city of Ahmedabad, I sketch the new paradoxes of the disconnected subject. It offers a critique of the tropes of access, presence, inclusion, and participation to show how digital humanities in South Asia needs a more critical investment in imagining its subjects as it takes on the politics of preservation, memory, and archiving.",,,,ISSN: 0275-9527; EISSN: 2573-9476; DOI: 10.1080/02759527.2019.1599551,,,Routledge,,,,,,,Taylor & Francis Library SSH - CRKN; Alma/SFX Local Collection,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_informaworld_taylorfrancis_310_1080_02759527_2019_1599551

Capturing Displaced Persons’ Agency by Modelling Their Life Events: A Mixed Method Digital Humanities Approach,Olaf Berg,"Historical social research (Köln), 2020-01-01, Vol.45 (4 (174)), p.263-289",,Contributions,,,"The International Tracing Service archives offer process-generated documents from resettlement programs for displaced persons (DP) after World War II. This paper addresses two key challenges to ongoing research based on those archival holdings: the generation of data; and the visual representation of that data in geographic information systems. Digital history offers the opportunity to go beyond case studies and use the wealth of process-generated documents as serial sources for algorithm-based analysis. However, data in that form does not exist as such, and thus needs to be generated – a process that implies interpretative acts such as abstraction, normalization, and trans-coding, which are shaped by the character of digital media. Can modeling a DP’s life into a series of events, and digitally processing the resultant data, help to find out more about the agency of DPs negotiating their destiny with the authorities? If the mostly hidden and implicit configurations of digital knowledge production are thoughtfully considered and geostatistical analysis is combined with close readings of selected source documents, hermeneutic and quantitative approaches can be reconciled via digital history. This mixed method approach has implications for research culture and the publication of such data.",,,,ISSN: 0172-6404,,,GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences,,,,,,,JSTOR Arts & Sciences X; Alma/SFX Local Collection,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_jstor_primary_26956101

Historians have long been alert to new tools as they become available to researchers. However, even as historians have revelled in the increased access to primary sources provided by digitisation and have analysed the opportunities that access offers, they have been aware of the unevenness of the digitisation process and the gaps it both creates and disguises. Issues of copyright and the ethics of creating public access to private lives have also caused historians concern. More recently, discussion about the evaluation of digital scholarship has begun. Often purely digital outputs are not formally recognised by their authors' institutions, despite having a significant online presence and contributing to scholarship. In parallel with being concerned about fairly assessing the work of peers, historians have also begun to consider how to teach (and assess) the digital skills now expected of history graduates.",,,,ISSN: 1478-0542; EISSN: 1478-0542; DOI: 10.1111/hic3.12492,,,"Oxford: Wiley Subscription Services, Inc",,,,,,,Wiley-Blackwell Full Collection - CRKN; Scholars Portal Journals: Wiley,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_proquest_journals_2117396573

Convergence of digital humanities and digital libraries,"Zhang, Ying ;  Liu, Shu ;  Mathews, Emilee","Library management, 2015-06-08, Vol.36 (4/5), p.362-377",,HR in libraries ;  Librarianship/library management ;  Library & information science,,,"Purpose
– Digital humanities (DH) has become a much discussed topic among both humanities scholars and library professionals. The library and information science (LIS) community has taken efforts in providing new facilities and developing new services to meet humanities scholars’ changing research behaviors and needs employing digital tools and methods. How to effectively collaborate with the DH community has been a challenging task to LIS in their digital library (DL) development endeavors. The purpose of this paper is to discover productive ways for LIS to support DH scholarship, specifically, what DL components, including content, technology, and service, should and could be developed for digital humanists.
Design/methodology/approach
– As an initial effort of the Digital Humanities Interest Group at University of California, Irvine Libraries, the examination is primarily based on a cross-boundary environmental scan in both DH and DL fields. The environmental survey includes both a literature review and web and physical site visits. The survey results, especially a gap analysis between the behaviors and needs of humanities scholars and the digital content, technologies, and services currently offered by the DL community, are used to shape the proposed roles of DH librarianship.
Findings
– First, DH’s innovative approach to research and teaching practices brings opportunities and challenges. Second, DH research is collaborative work. Third, major channels are established for the DH community. Fourth, various tools and data sets are developed to support different types of projects. Fifth, DH community has unbalanced geographical and disciplinary distribution. Sixth, DH research output still lacks attention, integration, and sustainability. Finally, LIS professionals play unique roles in DH projects. Overall, the communities of DH and DL share common goals and tasks.
Practical implications
– This paper proposes these present and future roles of LIS professionals: creator and contributor; curator; messenger and liaison; educator; mediator and interpreter; host; partner; innovator; “hybrid scholar”; advocate; consultant. At the organizational level, libraries should demonstrate higher efficiency and effectiveness in the services by revamping organizational culture or structure to stimulate and realize more and deeper cross-boundary conversations and collaborations. On a larger scale, the DL community should strive to become more visible, valuable, and approachable to the DH community; and even better, become part of it.
Originality/value
– This paper examines both DH and DL fields critically and connects the two communities by discovering gaps and commonalities. Based on the findings, the authors recommend roles and actions to be taken by LIS professionals, libraries, and the DL community. This paper is valuable to both humanities scholars who are seeking support in their research using digital methods and LIS professionals who are interested in providing more effective and suitable services. The paper also helps library administrators and aspiring librarians better understand the concept of DH and grasp insight on the present and future of DH librarianship.",,,,ISSN: 0143-5124; EISSN: 1758-7921; DOI: 10.1108/LM-09-2014-0116,,,Emerald Group Publishing Limited,,,,,,,Emerald Management 120,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1108_LM_09_2014_0116

Each of the commentators approached the topic through their own lens-Melinda Baldwin as a historian of scientific journals, Christopher Green as a pioneer in digital history of psychology, and Ted Porter as a historian of quantification. In my response, I tried to reply to the 3 comments by critically discussing 4 themes the special section has raised: the relationship between digital history and conventional history, the perspective that takes databases as both sources for historians and objects in history, the relationship between ""thick descriptions"" and ""thin"" digital ones, and finally, the role of digital history as a type of a ""trading creole"" between scientists working in quantified disciplines like scientific psychology and less quantified ones like history. I think the commentators have rightly observed some pitfalls in the uncritical application of digital history. On the other hand, in my response, I argue that the careful use of digital methods, where the user stays in communication with nondigital historians, opens new perspectives for historians of science, historians of psychology, and psychologists themselves.

This article makes use of extensive digital collections of historical newspapers to discuss the promising, yet challenging relationship between digital humanities and historical research. The search for long-term patterns in digital historical research appropriately positions itself within previous approaches to historical research, but the digitization of sources presents many practical and theoretical questions and obstacles. For this reason, any digital source used in historical research should be critically reviewed beforehand.

The early history of digital humanities: An analysis of Computers and the Humanities (1966–2004) and Literary and Linguistic Computing (1986–2004),"Sula, Chris Alen ;  Hill, Heather V","Digital Scholarship in the Humanities, 2019-11-05",,,,,"Abstract Most commentators locate the origin of digital humanities (DH) in computational text analysis of the mid-twentieth century, beginning in 1946 with Roberto Busa’s plans for the Index Thomisticus, a massive attempt to encode nearly 11 million words of Thomas Aquinas’ writings on IBM punch cards. This event (and the narrative that follows) is found throughout the literature, leading some to believe that early DH work ‘concentrated, perhaps somewhat narrowly, on text analysis (such as classification systems, mark-up, text encoding, and scholarly editing)’ (Presner, 2010, p. 6). Others seem convinced that DH is still only text analysis or too dominated by it (Meeks, 2013)—and misguided in its approach (Fish, 2012). Meanwhile, Underwood (2017) has recently made a case for disentangling distant reading methods from DH generally, noting that the former predates and does not depend on digital technology. This article presents an empirical perspective on the early history of DH by tracing publications in two foundational journals (Computers and the Humanities (CHum), established in 1966, and Literary and Linguistic Computing (LLC), established in 1986), with particular emphasis on media types, authors’ disciplines and locations, and teaching and learning. In doing so, we examine the extent to which early DH work focused on text analysis as well as broader trends in the early history of the field.",,,,ISSN: 2055-7671; EISSN: 2055-768X; DOI: 10.1093/llc/fqz072,,,,,,,,,,Oxford Journals - CRKN,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1093_llc_fqz072
"Sectarianism, the Nonconformist Conscience, and ‘British Pluralism’: The Digital Humanities and the Language of Home Rule, c.1910–1914","Colbrook, Stephen","20th century British history, 2020-06-01, Vol.31 (2), p.145-169",,,,,"Abstract
In recent years, historians have reassessed the political importance of the third Home Rule Bill. Important works by G. K. Peatling, Daniel Jackson, and David Thackeray have overturned the once-dominant view that the measure was a straightforward distraction from social reform. Yet, this scholarship has focused almost exclusively on the response of Unionists to Home Rule, and few works discuss the measure’s significance for Edwardian Liberals. This article rectifies this historiographical oversight by comparing the Liberal and Unionist response to the third Home Rule Bill in Devonshire and Lancashire. Using techniques from the digital humanities, I have shown that the measure dominated the grassroots political discourse of both parties before the First World War.",,,,ISSN: 0955-2359; EISSN: 1477-4674; DOI: 10.1093/tcbh/hwz042,,,Oxford University Press,,,,,,,Oxford Journals - CRKN; Scholars Portal Journals: Oxford Current,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1093_tcbh_hwz042
From provider to partner: how digital humanities sparked a change in Gale’s relationship with universities,"Houghton, Chris ;  Ketchley, Sarah","Insights the UKSG journal, 2019-10-16, Vol.32 (1)",,academic publishing ;  Alliances and partnerships ;  Curricula ;  digital archives ;  digital humanities ;  gale ;  Humanities ;  Information services ;  Information services industry ;  libraries ;  primary sources ;  Technology application ;  United Kingdom ;  United States ;  Universities and colleges,,,"The past decade has seen huge growth in the teaching and research of what is broadly called digital humanities (DH). Increases in computing power and data availability have seen a rise in individual researchers and research groups working on digital scholarship projects in the humanities, arts and social sciences. This article shows how publishers of traditional digital archives have adapted to the increasing prevalence of DH amongst their traditional customers. The success of this adaptation depends entirely on the relationship with the academic community, and Gale has seen a shift from being a provider of products to a partner, trusted to help libraries, scholars and institutions achieve their objectives. As a leading global provider of digital archives, Gale is well placed to review the current state of DH research and teaching, and this article will discuss significant academic events that have brought scholars, librarians and students together, and the lessons learned for institutions around the world looking to expand into DH. Finally, the article looks at how working to understand the common challenges and barriers to DH research and teaching has pushed many archive publishers to re-evaluate traditional archive publishing and enable new and innovative ways to explore the past.

This contrasts with the wealth of potential opportunities that could arise from closer collaborations. We argue that more efforts are needed to make NLP tools work for DH datasets so that that NLP research applied to humanities data receives more attention, leading to the development of evaluation approaches tailored towards relevant research questions. This has the potential to bring methodological advances to NLP, while at the same time confronting DH datasets with powerful state-of-the-art techniques.",,,,ISSN: 1938-4122; EISSN: 1938-4122,,,Alliance of Digital Humanities,,,,,,,Freely Accessible Arts & Humanities Journals; Alma/SFX Local Collection,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_hal_shs_oai_HAL_hal_02970302v1

Computer Vision and the Digital Humanities: Adapting Image Processing Algorithms and Ground Truth through Active Learning,"Musik, Christoph ;  Zeppelzauer, Matthias","View (Utrecht), 2018-12-31, Vol.7 (14), p.59-72",,Active Learning ;  Computer Vision ;  Digital Humanities ;  Explainable Artificial Intelligence ;  Ground Truth Generation ;  Image Understanding ;  Machine Learning,,,"Automated computer vision methods and tools offer new ways of analysing audio-visual material in the realm of the Digital Humanities (DH). While there are some promising results where these tools can be applied, there are basic challenges, such as algorithmic bias and the lack of sufficient transparency, one needs to carefully use these tools in a productive and responsible way. When it comes to the socio-technical understanding of computer vision tools and methods, a major unit of sociological analysis, attentiveness, and access for configuration (for both computer vision scientists and DH scholars) is what computer science calls “ground truth”. What is specified in the ground truth is the template or rule to follow, e.g. what an object looks like. This article aims at providing scholars in the DH with knowledge about how automated tools for image analysis work and how they are constructed. Based on these insights, the paper introduces an approach called “active learning” that can help to configure these tools in ways that fit the specific requirements and research questions of the DH in a more adaptive and user-centered way. We argue that both objectives need to be addressed, as this is, by all means, necessary for a successful implementation of computer vision tools in the DH and related fields.",,,,ISSN: 2213-0969; EISSN: 2213-0969; DOI: 10.18146/2213-0969.2018.jethc153,,,Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision,,,,,,,Alma/SFX Local Collection; Film & Television Literature Index with Full Text,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_crossref_primary_10_18146_2213_0969_2018_jethc153

The inevitable question arose: How does one become 'future-ready'? The answer lies, in part, in proactively engaging with evolving technologies and improving individual staff digital dexterities. Coinciding with release of The Future-Ready Library strategy, the Digital Literacy Workplace Program was put in place to foster upskilling opportunities for Library staff. One of the outcomes of this program was the creation of a local Digital Humanities Community of Practice in 2018. This article focuses on the transformative journey of the Community of Practice in developing staff digital dexterity through the completion of mini projects. These mini projects incorporated both hard and soft skillsets to develop agile, future-focused, T-shaped professionals. While initially directed at developing digital dexterity and increased knowledge of the Digital Humanities, the Community of Practice recognized the need for adoption of a broader, more strategic approach, to support clients and staff in this area. This resulted in the launch of the Digital Scholarship Strategy project in 2020. The project group was tasked with scoping the feasibility of initiating a Library-led roll-out across the organization, or a tighter focused implementation within the UOW Library operational environment. The expedited move to online teaching and learning as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the timeliness and applicability of these initiatives.",,,,ISSN: 1057-2317; EISSN: 1095-9297; DOI: 10.1080/10572317.2020.1785173,,,Routledge,,,,,,,Taylor & Francis Library SSH - CRKN,,https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/17erkeh/cdi_informaworld_taylorfrancis_310_1080_10572317_2020_1785173
