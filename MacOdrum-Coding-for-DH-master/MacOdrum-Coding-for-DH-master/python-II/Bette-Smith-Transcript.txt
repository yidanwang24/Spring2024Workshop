My name is Bette Smith, and I grew up in Ottawa in the Carleton, Carling area, sorry I'm going back a little bit. And I went to Fisher Park High School, and while I was there, I went to Grade 13, which usually prepares you for university. However, in my Grade 13 year, I really didn't feel I wanted to go to university, but I decided instead to take the money that my parents had put aside for me for schooling or whatever and went to business college instead. So I took a year at Willis Business College in downtown Ottawa, and at the end of that, they just said to me well, where would you like to work? And I said maybe I would like to work at the university. So they actually got me the job, I didn't apply. And I started at Carleton University in 1972, so I would have been just 19 years of age. I started as a steno 03, which is basically the bottom of the pile, and I remember that I made 3,500 a year. Which at that point wasn't enough to live on by yourself, even in those dollar days. But I did live at home for another couple of years. And basically I started off as a steno 03, and then I rose a bit through the ranks. So, my years at Carleton were formative in terms of where I was going, towards administration or. 

Yeah. Now just a little, just in terms of your own family. Siblings?


I have four sisters and two brothers. So I'm one of 7. And in the pecking order I would be the 2nd youngest, and of those in my family, if we're looking at class, which I know is an interest for this particular thesis study, my mother was middle class. My dad would have been from a farm family. And I do remember him sort of going over his finances at one time and being quite proud to tell me that he felt that he had achieved middle class. Although lower middle class, but middle class nonetheless. And in terms of my siblings, the eldest went on to be accounts payable, accounts receivable work. My brother Gordon went on to do a Master's in social work, sorry not social work, sociology and actually did some doctoral work at London School of Economics. Margaret went on to be a secretary for a law firm. Pat went on to be Master's of Library Science as well as a degree in journalism. And then DJ of course is also done graduate work in Political Science, actually as well as now history. Edward has done writing, but so it's a real mix bag in terms of whether we've gone on to university studies or whether we've gone into what you might call more support roles. I actually do have a bachelor's degree in English lit, and I put it to good use in correcting everybody's grammar that I could possibly correct.

Now when did you do your BA in English lit?


I started a couple of courses at Carleton when I was there because one of the perks of being staff is that you get free courses. So I certainly took advantage of that. So I took two courses I believe at Carleton. One in classics and one in sociology. And then I transferred those to Laurier University where I finished off my degree, because I eventually ended up working at Laurier.

And when did you finish the degree at Laurier?


It took me 13 years. I finished in 1986 as a part time student. I think there was one year where I actually did 3 courses in a term. And that was insane. Yeah it's very hard, as you know, to work, to work full time and do courses. And have a family, you know. Luckily, you know, I was a single, so.

Now when you say that your mom was middle class, what do you mean by that?


Well she grew up in the village of Cumberland, but her family and her dad was the postmaster as well as owned a store in the village. And then they moved to Ottawa, I mean lived in a really fine home with a cook, he sold insurance and was in fact a top salesman for one of the big companies. So I don't know that they had a great deal of money, but they lived a middle class lifestyle. A cook, somebody would come in and clean, my mother never learned how to cook an egg until she got married because she hasn't been allowed in the kitchen. So my dad was the cook.

Now when you say he was from a farm family, was he from this area?


He was from a little farm that was basically just between Cumberland and Rockland. In fact, we're going out to Cumberland tomorrow for a memorial service. So I can see all the friends and relatives.

So then did he, when, did he work that farm?


Dad was never really, he loved gardening but he was not friends with the animals. They would, apparently, when he was growing up, and you have to understand he was born in 1908, they had draft horses. And they apparently never did anything that dad would tell them to do. He was much more at home with machinery. Loved tinkering with machinery. And he also enjoyed his work later on with the City of Ottawa which was in the filtration plant. He worked with the machinery there as well as with the chemical tests and so forth.

So how did they, did he move to Ottawa when he got married, or?


Yes. Actually his first job here in Ottawa, or after he got married, was running the elevator at one of the stores downtown, Ogilvieï¿½s or so forth, where they still let people go on. Mom would come down with a little bag for his lunch, and they would ride the elevator up and down together, which I thought was very romantic.

Yeah, absolutely. And then he at some point started to work for the City?


Yes, I think his brother in law got him a job, first of all during the war as a guard for the filtration plant. Which was kind of a lunatic job in and of itself because they didn't give them bullets for the guns. And then they made them stand just outside the building with all the lights on the guards. So you know, you could have been picked off and of course if anybody had fired at you, you had to run back into the building to get the bullets to come back out. So I don't think they were taking it pretty seriously. It was just more of a show.

Yeah, and then after the war? What happened?


For whatever reason, he was able to get a job within the plant, with I guess he showed himself to have some facilities with chemistry. You know, he had his high school, which at that point was pretty good for that time frame. And he had actually wanted to go on to university, but it was his mother pushing that. When she died, his dad said you don't need it. So he was always behind higher education.

Yeah. And how about your mom? Was she?


Actually, she went I think to about Grade 9 and at the time she was growing up as well. High school ,even, for young ladies, wasn't necessary. But she did actually go back after my dad passed away and finished her high school. Yeah. She was very proud.

So, when she was growing up, they had the cook and the cleaner and that kind of thing. Now when you were growing up, what was your household like?


Crowded. Of course. Our, it was our grandmother, our mother's mother who bought the house straight out for mom and dad. Otherwise they probably could not have afforded it. But she bought a very large house, beautifully made, it had two large bedrooms, one very small bedroom. And my parents actually ended up, they had a fold-up couch downstairs, so we always knew that you couldn't get up until Mom and Dad were up, couldn't walk around at night, you know. There wasn't a lot of privacy in that house, but it was fun nonetheless. And of course mom did most of the work but we were trained early to help.

And, did they stay in that house a long time?


Yes. They, I think they moved there when my brother was maybe about 2 or 3. So fairly, you know, that would have been about 1943, 1945. And they stayed there certainly throughout Dad's entire married life. And then mother sold it maybe about 10 years after Dad died. Because it was just too difficult to keep up and too expensive on a pension.

Yeah, yeah. Now if there was sort of one memory growing up that kind of is characteristic of your family, or sort of showed something about your family culture, what would it be? Did you guys do, have special traditions, or take trips together, or?


The one trip we did take together was something of a disaster. Dad had decided he wanted to show us the St. Laurence, so we all started out, packed into this little car. It wasn't really that little of a car, it was an Oldsmobile, but you know there were at least 4 kids in the back and mom and dad in the front, because the older kids didn't come.

Along, and we got to a certain place and he said, There! There's the St. Laurence! And we all said, where, where? And he said, Way over there! Now we're going home. Okay. He just had enough, you know of the driving and the kids carping and so forth. So we did not drive a lot. I guess if we did any kind of driving at all it would be to go out and go to our grandmother's cottage, really, and that I remember as a lot of fun.


And where was the cottage?


It was on the Ottawa River, just at Cumberland, as you go across to Buckingham.


And would spend lots of time there?


Well, we spent a couple of weeks there sometimes each summer, just the youngest kids with my mother's cousin Mary who had an adjacent lot. And there was one summer actually where Mother actually, well, Deanna actually burned the house down in Ottawa, and we got to spend almost the entire summer at my grandmother's cottage while the house was being rebuilt.


The house that you grew up in that was burned down? Wow.


Yes. Well it wasn't really Deanna's fault. She'd come home from high school, she was burning all her papers, that was a fun thing apparently to do. We had a wooden roof, and a spark went up and I guess there was a fault in the chimney and the roof caught fire. So it was during the day, so we all went rushing out, and of course the roof burned, the top, the attic burned, the top floor was pretty well destroyed. So there was a lot of work to be done. We had a full insurance so that wasn't a problem, but we couldn't live in the house for the whole summer. So we went to our grandmother's cottage. And that was a golden, that was a golden summer for me, really.


Yeah. What was it like living and growing up in Ottawa at that time?


It, we lived in a very busy area. So I lived at the corner of Gladstone and Parkdale. It was probably as busy then as it is now. Those are two main streets. And as we were growing up of course, the Queensway was being built. I have to say that my sister and brother and I used to play chicken with the trucks as they were building the Queensway. Never told my dad of course, we would have been in big trouble. And you know we used to go off on walks and so forth, but even then there were some strange people around, you know. So we knew. We were street smart. You didn't go out after dark, really, you locked your doors at night. It was a safe neighborhood, but not so you would not take precautions.


Yeah. And did you guys like know your neighbours and socialize with your neighbours and that kind of thing, or?


Certainly quite a few. Like most of the people on our street, Gladstone, up until I guess it was just the next side street, had been there for you know 20, 30 years. So I know all, knew all the little kids, I was friends with them. And with some of the older folks as well. There was an older couple, I can't even quite remember their last name, but they were the sweetest couple and they would always have cookies for us. And they loved little kids but they'd never had any of their own. So we'd always go and sit on their porch and have lemonade and cookies with them. But our parents knew them. Our parents knew all the parents. And they always knew where we were.


Yeah. And how, when you were going to the Willis Business College, how did you get there?


By bus. Yeah. So I would just, I forget which bus I would take, downtown to Sussex and get off, and just walk. I think Willis is still there, I forget exactly what street it's on, but it is still there.


Okay. So, you, finished at Fisher Park High school, Grade 13, you went to the Willis Business College, and then you started at Carleton. So, where, which department were you in?


Sociology, Anthropology. I think that, the 7th floor of the Loeb Building.


And, what was, what, what would a typical day have been like for you?


Well it would start with, I worked in what was a pool of 3 stenos. So there was me, there was Linda, and Muriel. And Mary Jones was the administrative person in charge. I was apparently to report to her, but we didn't really. We reported to Eleanor Curry. Who was the departmental secretary, and she also took care of the graduate records. And she had one of the stenos who helped her with the graduate records. And then there was another steno who helped the undergraduate secretary, Harriet. With her records. And these were the two secretaries who basically kept track of the students who were registered for that stream, making sure that they were getting the proper courses, and signed up for the proper courses. It wasn't done by computer, it was all basically hand files.


Yeah, yeah. And, so would like, Muriel have done grad and Linda have done undergrad, something like that, or?


Yes. I think to begin with. I was the newest one on the block. What also happened is you would have all the faculty


who would have typing to be done, or transcription of tapes to be done, and they would just simply bring them in to the office, basically to Mrs. Curry, and it would come out to whoever had the time to do that particular work. And depending on who the faculty person or what the job was, or who ranked where, you know, there might be a little bit of jockeying in terms of what went to the top of the work pile.


And can you remember any of the profs who were on faculty at the time?


Oh, most definitely. I've got a good memory for that. This was where sometimes we may have to stop the camera. The chairman was Mooney Frumharts. And Mooney was a lovely man. He was really a very proper and private man. But he could also go on at great length with his memos. So if you got a memo to type for Mooney, and he was very particular. He didn't like mistakes being made. It could be 3 pages long and you'd have to do like 6 carbons, okay? So you had to be very careful because you didn't really have white-out at that point. You had to go back and basically erase carefully, all the copies and then put in another carbon piece to get it back in. And I mean, we had electric typewriters, that was, that was fine. But there was no such thing as the erase tape at that point. So you really did have to be very careful. And we of course had a number, he was a sociologist, we had quite a few who did, tables. Statistical tables. Very complex ones, and so if you're in business college you learn how to set these up. And there's a particular way of figuring it out. The computer doesn't do it for you, you had to measure things out, know how many spaces across the page you had to work with, and map it basically. But you also had to remember that if you were doing, statistical tables, and you had carbons, you had to be very careful when you were making corrections, because as one professor said, and I think it was Professor McFarlane, he was very annoyed with one of the stenos. It wasn't me. Because what she was doing was she was just typing it over and handing it back to him, and he said, Well, what is the number? Is it 675 or is it 665? I can't tell. This is ruined. And it's oh, you know, got to use your noggin here. So I do remember at a certain point, I very naively made a suggestion: maybe we could be more efficient, just have certain professors could just work with certain stenos. And instead of just waiting in line, we would sort of divvy up the work. Well apparently it started a stampede.      , we want Bette! So I obviously must have improved, you know, impressed people at that point. And then there was a little bit of a change because Lynn, who was the chair secretary, left unexpectedly. And I'll tell you off camera why. But I got her position, so I went to work for the chair of the department way off in the other end of the building, by myself, and Mooney. And kept all of the materials that were used for job searches as well as for the tenure committee and so forth. Very high level and confidential materials for the faculty. And I do remember one faculty person coming in. His nickname was Nosey. And he asked if he couldn't have a file. And I said, well, that person isn't coming up for anything, not for tenure, not for a promotion. He said, I know, I just want to look at their file. And Professor Frumharts was in his office, and he said - this little quiet voice comes out, That question was not appropriate, come into my office. Off goes the professor. So you had to be on your toes sometimes in terms of, at that point, I learned early, confidentiality of records was becoming important. Although it was sort of a new idea at that point I think.


Now when did you become, if you started in 1972, when did you become the chair's secretary?


I think it was after 1 year.


Oh, okay, okay.


I won't swear to that.


No, that's okay. So, who else was in the department. There was Professor Frumhart, Bruce McFarlane?


John Harpe, also a sociologist. Gertrude, might have been Ritter as her last name. And she was married to Zbigniew.


How do you spell Zbigniew?


That's his first name. Z-B-I-G-N-I-E-W or something. It was a bit of a joke because we also had a graduate student whose first name was Zbigniew. So you'd hear the call come out, Zbigniew. And it was, well which one? And Professor Frumhart also had a research assistant whose name was  Bette. And also not short for Elizabeth. Because mine is also  Bette, not short for Elizabeth. So you'd say Bette! Well, which one? We had Terry Nosanchuk.


And I wonder how you spell Nosanchuk.


I think it's N-O-S-A-N-C-H-U-K. And I believe his wife's name was Monica, I can't remember her last name. Might have been Zentner. The person who followed him, I'm drawing a blank on some of the names.


That's okay. But there was a, John Porter, would have been there?


Oh my gosh, yes. John Porter was a very important person. Everybody knew it. Apparently he was a lovely, sweet person. I just found him a bit of a diva. He could be very demanding but you know, us lesser people down there. There was one day where I really had to get going, I had an important appointment after work, I want to leave, and he said I've got this, and it needs to be done. You will stay and you will do it. I said,


Okay, I'll do it. So I stayed, I did it, had it all ready, went to go and get it for him. They said, oh! He left half an hour ago. And I thought, F-U, John P. Anyway, but apparently his word was golden. And of course, he meant money to the university in terms of his connections to the, what would it be, Statistics Canada, right, in terms of the Porter, what was it, the Ledane Commission. He was on that. My brother Gordon actually worked with him on that.


Oh, Okay. Ledane. L-E-D-


A-N-E? That was on the one on, you know, liquor, use of alcohol, marijuana and so forth. And of course he was also writing the Vertical Mosaic. I think Gordon was also involved with the Vertical Mosaic.


Okay, yeah, okay. And so, was it, there must have been more folks with that. A fairly large department?


It was very large and I think it carried a lot of weight. As I said, if you had the connections to government, and government grants and so forth, probably sociology was one of the big ones. To a lesser extent, Anthropology. And I do remember that there was a bit of a tussle between. Because they were in the same department. There was a little hyphen there. But I think the sociologists considered the anthropologists to be a lesser type of being. Just step down, yes.


So I'm sensing that there was a hierarchy in the department.


Oh, a huge, huge, as a matter of fact, if a faculty person went on sabbatical, they basically had to vacate their office because there weren't sufficient offices. The problem came in that most of the full faculty, like the professors, felt that they had a right to the corner offices. The corner offices had more space,      r windows. And there was one major frou-ha-ha, and I don't remember who it was, but the professor came back from his sabbatical, only to find that the associate professor in that office refused to move. Refused to go back to a lower state office. And that just was, you know, apparently a matter of major contention. So it wasn't just the money for them, it was the status in terms of where their office was, the sort of perks they got, the office staff available to them, etc. And I know that some of them got government grants for their typing and so forth. But we were doing it free. It was coming through the office.


So in terms of then the general hierarchy in the department that included support staff, what would that have been, do you think? Like how did the?


The support staff?


Well, the hierarchy in the department, I'm kind of assuming from the chair on down, would that have been how it works?


Oh yes. Well you would have the arts dean, I think it was the dean of arts who was on the 3rd floor if I remember. And social sciences were still I believe under the arts at that point, I don't know if it's changed since then. So then you would have, each department would have the chair. The chair would be there for a number of years. There would be an assistant chair, as far as I can remember, somebody who reported as a faculty member to the chair, and in terms of support staff, there was an administrative assistant, that was Mary, Mary Jones, I'm not I have to say 100% sure what that job entailed. I'm presuming it has something to do with rooms and space and courses and so forth. Then you had the departmental secretary who was also the graduate secretary, the undergraduate secretary, and I believe the chair's secretary would be one down but still higher than the 3 stenos who were in the main office. In addition to that, a number of faculty including the chair would have a research assistant. And there was at least 1 lab person and that was Tony Falsetto. That was for the anthropology area.


Okay. And what was your sense of the pecking order then, how did that play out? Was the formal structure, was that played out in everyday life?


I think by and large that the staff


Content

Speaker

Got along well. The only problem would have probably been our admin assistant who had something of a need to control. And so we were always sort of having loggerheads with Mary because she'd sort of swoop down to see what we were doing. And she were also, we were positive her husband would call about 5 minutes before 4:30 just to see if we were answering the phone. But we always knew it was Charles. Yes, we're still here, do you need to speak with someone, oh, okay, that's fine goodbye. But that was it, and you know you get that anywhere.


Sure. And how, how was your relationship with the faculty?


That could be a little contentious because, just depending on whether something was trying to be pushed forward in terms of getting it into the work flow, that could be a little bit of a problem. You know if you were working on something and you had 3 other manuscript and somebody said, Oh well I need that manuscript tomorrow, well why didn't you give it to me last week? You know, I've already got two people ahead of you. That was a problem. But that wasnï¿½t really up to us to sort out. That was up to Eleanor, and she was a very capable and diplomatic person. So we didn't really have to contend with that. If that was a problem for the department, it happened elsewhere.


So generally speaking, how would you describe the culture, the feeling on campus at that time? Sort of the culture of the workplace or whatever, you know?


I think that there was a great divide between the faculty and the staff. That is for sure. It's not to say that the faculty were ignorant of the needs of staff, a number of them were absolutely wonderful and so forth. But the view is always different from the bottom up than from the top down. And they had their own concerns. I mean I worked enough on universities to know what published perish means. And so for some of these folks who were trying to get ahead, or the graduate students, there was a lot of pressure on them. And as I said, as staff members, I was in some sense shielded from that. First by the graduate secretary, who was the departmental secretary, and then by Muni Frumhartz, who basically said to faculty, if you've got a problem, you bring it to me, you don't bring it to the staff. He was very good that way.
Yeah. So he, it sounds like he was protective.


He was, I think to a certain extent. He was very old-fashioned in his views and in his treatment of women. Not to say that he treated us like China dolls or anything, but that he had respect for us, and I believe he had respect for our work as long as we did our job and did it well. He didn't really care for slackers I don't think.


Yeah. Did you have any sense of what the general take on, was, on women working, or, and faculty being women, and any of that sense?


There were a number of faculty women at that point. There was at least one anthropology faculty person and unfortunately I can't remember her name. She was a total joy to work with. Why? Because she had started as a secretary and then had decided that no, that wasn't her field, she wanted to go into anthropology herself. But when she had materials ready to hand in, they were already scripted through. If she had transcription which she did, she did it in a way where you know, end of paragraph. New paragraph. And then she'd go on. She wouldn't mumble through words and then you'd get to the end of a three paragraph and then it would say, Oh, actually, no, let's go back to the 2nd paragraph, I need to change something. And already, you know, Iï¿½m not doing this on computer folks, this is on a typewriter. So you knew well with some people that you shouldn't start on your transcription until you'd listened to the whole tape. But with this one particular faculty person, as I said, she was very careful in how she prepared work. And it was always that you just did it. And it was always easy to do.


Yeah. What was the dress code at the time?


Dress code? I don't know that there was a particular dress code. As a matter of fact, we're talking about the early 70s, we were wearing minis. And I can remember wearing a mini so short that, you'd have your


Three filing cabinets, I literally couldn't get anything out of the lower filing cabinet without going down, down, down, down, pull it open, up up up up up. Because you know it was just too revealing. And of course we also wore stiletto heels at that point. So no, I can't remember being anything other than a young floozy.


Did that change at all, can you remember when people started to wear pants?


There were actually pants about that time, I'm actually going to a family reunion, and we were asked to put together memories of our parents, and one of my memories of my mom is in the later 70s, she went out and as a woman in her 60s, going to Church, she bought red. And I'm talking fire engine red pantsuit. Which she wore. And it was kind of like *GASP*, but you know, she did it anyways. So pantsuits at that point were just coming on to the idea of being able to wear it in a business or a formal place. They were really more leisure.


Yeah. So, can you, you remembered with tremendous accuracy your starting-


Oh, I can tell you, K1S 5B6.


Was that your-?


That's Carleton's postal code.


Yes, yes.


It's engrained. I'll have Alzheimer's and I'll still remember it.


Yeah. Now did you, did you socialize with the people you worked with it at all, did you, coffee breaks, lunch, outside of work?


I did with, not really with the two stenos. We really were in different worlds apart. Muriel was a party girl. She loved to party, and she had her own group of friends off campus. And Linda, actually started out at age 17, and married at a very young age, and she was very traditional. You know as soon as she was married, it was husband, home to husband, and I think her whole idea was going to have babies, going to retire. At that point, most women when they were working, if they had a family, at least at our level, would stop working. At a certain point I don't think it really paid to be a secretary and to have a family and work. I actually socialized more with Eleanor Currie, and Harriet Abbott. Harriet was divorced, she was just a wonderful woman. And Eleanor was married, and was a total sweetheart. Total sweetheart. Both of whom were extremely capable working women. Harriet because she was divorced and raising a family, Eleanor because she had always worked, and she was older. She was in her 50s at that point, but she had never stopped working. And I think I got from them also a sense of what it means to be a professional secretary, as opposed to having a gap in terms of, Well, I'm just doing this, but someday I'm going to do something else. Family or something else. For me, it became more of a career.


Yeah. And how do you think they defined being a professional secretary?


Well, I think it really comes with the attitude that you bring to your work. That you do your best, that you use the skills and enhance your skills so that what the work is, that you're making, I've always tried to say that I'm not a gatekeeper. A lot of people see the secretary, or I guess it's the support staff person nowadays, as the gatekeeper, the person who keeps you from doing what it is that you want to do. And my feeling has always been that the support staff person really is the person who should be making it easier for you to get where you're going. Not necessarily where you think you should be going, but the quickest way to get to your goal. Sometimes that means saying no.


Now, do you, from, so, tell me a little bit about. Do you remember knowing anything about the president at the time, knowing who the senior executives were, how the relationship between department and that senior administration?


Not at the senior level, no. I would say that most of our world really revolved around, the Senate certainly was important to the faculty. And in terms of what was going on in our building, it was probably more the dean of arts, that group of departments all jockeying for grants or time or space or whatever. Or faculty. Because you know there would be a cap on the number of money you'd get. And certainly when I was going through, the only hint I had that there were problems, was that we were coming on a time where people started talking about retrenchment and attrition, and that of course would have been the first time that it crossed my tiny brain that universities were subject to government grants.


Right, yeah. So, so just to finish up on socialization too, did you guys, like where did you do coffee and lunch and stuff like that?


Basically the bottom floor of the Loeb building had a cafeteria, which was interesting in and of itself. There was one day when I was in line. Someone comes trotting through with another person in tow, just passed all of us in line and goes to the front of the line and just waltzes through. And I'm just sort of looking at him and thinking, just a second, back of the line, back of the line! And then I realized, oh, that's Lester B. Pearson who had just become like a fellow of the university or whatever. He had just retired.


Chancellor, maybe?


No I think he had gotten some major you know, when a Prime Minister steps down and then they get a seat at the university, teaching position. So that was Lester B. Pearson up at the front, and I thought, mmm hmm, mmm hmm, man of the people. Straight to the front.


Did you ever see the president there at all, or?


No, not in that building. They were way in another area of campus, and in fact I was in the admin building occasionally. Usually sometimes you'd go down through the tunnels and the only thing that I remembered about that, was if I had to go away over to the admin building for whatever reason to drop something off, the maintenance people, or the not maintenance, but the physical side of people, I'm not sure if they call it physical plant, would sometimes give us a ride on their carts if were stuck we could hitch a ride.


Now where was the admin building at that point?


I'm not certain but I thought it was way closer to Colonel By than the Loeb. We were sort of stuck way off, you know.


I wonder if it was in what we now call Robertson Hall.


It could be. I really didn't have much of a life beyond the Loeb Building. Occasionally somebody would mention something going on at St. Patrick's College for whatever reason but that was also sort of no man's land.


Yeah, yeah yeah. So-


The library was close by.


Yeah. So you mentioned sort of knowing, hearing a little bit about retrenchment and attrition, can you remember anything sort of specific about that?


Just, rumbles in terms of you know, if moneys are being pulled back, then positions may be lost through attrition. And that was the first actually hint of unionization that I caught, really. Was that the faculty were saying, Well, if positions are going to be pulled back, then they should not be faculty positions that are lost, they should really take them from staff positions. And in addition, if they take them from staff positions, then it needs to be ensured that the work that's done for the faculty cannot be cut back accordingly. Same amount of work needs to be done by the people who remain. Which is kind of, Oh, thank you very much. And of course we had no voice.


Okay. So, tell me then a little bit sort of more about that. So you began to sort of become aware that there was this talk going on, and that there could be positions lost, and do you, do you remember anything sort of more specific about unionization, were you approach, did you go to meetings?


Well were certainly approached. And I can't remember the process per se, I think that there were, there was already a staff association in place. And I believe that there was basically a meeting held for general information and that most of us went to that meeting. Whether it was held on campus or off, I'm not sure. But there were what I would call a number of Young Turks, the younger men especially who would have been, you know, the lab workers, or in the library, the professionals. Because we, the staff association at that point had everybody in it who was not really faculty. Except I believe for grounds and so forth. They would have been separate anyway. And it was basically more, well, the faculty have now unionized, and this is what the faculty are trying to put forward as part of their bargaining. If you don't want the university to agree to that, then it's best that we organize. How we organize is the, was the contentious issue. Iï¿½m not certain that people were, not wanting to have a voice. That would be very important. But I think that there was a lot of concern perhaps among the older people, I can't say for sure. But when you have a union, and you have a call for money coming out towards award chest, it follows that at some point, you're probably going to go on strike. And of course, they said, oh no no no. That's not what we're thinking. We're just trying to have a voice in the bargaining. And if we bargain, if we unionize, then they have to bargain with us.


In good faith. They cannot simply bargain with the faculty and then we get the leftover pie.


Yeah. Now can you remember who the president of your, who was sort of leading the charge on this?


I wouldn't have a clue.


Okay. What was the feeling or the thinking, like, did you talk about it amongst yourselves in your office? You and the other stenos or?


Not a huge amount. I think there was more of a feeling of, we're going to probably unionize, and we're going to hold our nose. What really surprised us though, was as we began the collective process, or the drive I should say. The university became extremely nasty in terms of, Okay, you can't be part of the union, you can't be part of the union, you can't be part of the union, basically trying to ensure that the fewest number of people would be included. And as I understand it there was some intimidation going on, I can't tell you what it was but it was the feeling that, not from our faculty either, I didn't get any sense that they were saying no you shouldn't unionize. As a matter of fact, I think there was some support for us in that process. But I think that higher up, there was a sense that they didn't really want the staff to unionize, because at that point, you know, we were, they basically were just telling us what we would get. And then they would have to unionize, they would have to bargain with us. And that made it more difficult than with the faculty because that was really part and parcel of the faculty demands that included work done by staff. I don't know how the library would have been included but faculty had a stake in what work was being done for them in the offices.


Right. So you mentioned that there was something about, well, this is what the faculty's going for and if you don't want that to happen we should unionize. Can you sort of explain that a little bit more for me?


Just basically that the feeling was that the faculty having unionized, now had a voice and were bargaining with the university who had to listen to them first, because they had already unionized. I think I'm correct in that. And that, we were going to get the leftovers, or, if we didn't just get the leftovers, it was going to be the staff where the deepest cuts would be made. And it was going to be the support staff who were left who were going to have to pick up the slack and still do the work. So if in our area there were 3 stenos, they might cut it back to 2 stenos, and then the 2 that were left would do the work for all the faculty. It's not that they would say, Oh, well, you know, maybe the faculty should at this point then start taking some of their work elsewhere and if they're getting grants, pay for it elsewhere. No, no it still goes through gratis. And so the feeling was we were being made to take the burden on for the cuts that were coming down the pipe from the government.


Okay. So do you remember having to sign a slip, or you know that kind of thing?


Oh yes, absolutely, yeah. I mean that is the process. And of course at that point too, CUPE was trying to sign us up. CUPE was doing an active drive as well but I don't, I think when the final drive came, it was the support staff association that won out simply because they were less aggressive, and that I think people were more concerned, oh, if it's CUPE, not only do we have to be aware of what our local would be doing, but then we would have to turn around and be concerned about what other locals were doing. So that if another local on campus were on strike, we would have to then as a CUPE local, be concerned about crossing picket lines or whatever else. So the thought was, to my remembrance, if we went with the support staff association, at least it's in house.


Now, prior to unionization, if you got a raise, how did you find out about it? How did you find out about your annual salary and


Your raise prior to?


We would just get a letter.


From whom?


I believe it came from human resources.


And that would tell you what you got. Now did you have any sense that you guys were paid, like the stenos were paid the same, your increases kind of went up the same way, or?


I wouldn't have any idea about that. And I'm not sure whether that was shared as a percentage going up or not, I can't remember. The only letter I ever kept was my letter saying you have position, and it starts at 3900.


Yeah, yeah. So the signup comes and is there anything else sort of about that process, like can you remember how, how did the support staff association communicate with you regularly, I mean?


Oh, there were a lot of meetings going on. A lot of messages going out but Iï¿½m not quite certain of the means by which we got the notices that there would be meetings. And probably, well, gosh I should know. I believe that I was on the staff association as a rep. I didn't say, I didn't say a whole lot I can tell you that, I more listened. But our job was to take the information back to our area and give it to our people there. So perhaps that's why I remember so much. Did my name come up?


Yeah, it's in one of the, so do you ever remember getting a newsletter?


No I can't say that I do.


Okay. And how did, can you remember how you ended up on the support staff association as a rep?


Oh I think that they simply needed somebody from each area, and somebody said, oh,      , you go ahead and do it. And I said okay, I'll go.


Okay, yeah yeah. So, had, was there talk of unions and that kind of thing when you were growing up in your household? Like what sort of formed your sort of approach to this?


Oh, to the union. My dad was not fond of unions particularly. And at a certain point, actually, and I'm not sure that this colours my thoughts at all. My dad died in 1973 and he had had a run in with a staff member under him who was really just impossible. And dad was supposed to be giving him oversight, but he was finding him to be basically just difficult all the time. Lazy. Impossible to work with. Wasn't doing his job properly. But the problem for dad was, apparently this person was a union member. And there was very little that he could do other than basically take notes and sort of send him letters and you know, do that usual going through the union. And to a certain extent, when he died of a heart attack, we kind of blamed that person and the union for making his job as a supervisor pretty well impossible. It really added a great deal of, he hated oversight anyway. And it just made the job nasty. And you know, I feel that it may have shortened his life, just the anxiety and the stress. So I can't say for sure that that coloured my idea of the unions. I also remember having lunch in the little courtyard that's outside the Loeb building, I forget exactly where it is, and just sort of sitting in the sun enjoying it. And this young man came up and started talking to me, and of course I'm a young girl, so happy to talk. And it turned out, of course, that he was a Marxist. And he was trying to get me to sort of sign up for Marxism and I was thinking, well, why would I want to do that? I want a house, I want a good salary, I want all of these wonderful things and property. And he was kind of saying, no, no, it's the worker. You know, you as a worker need to be concerned about the workers of the world. And I thought, no. I don't. I need to be concerned about myself. So it's not that I wasn't concerned about my fellow workers, but I never really had a feeling that unions were necessarily the way I wanted to go about it.


So, how did you decide then that, given this sort of, these things, were sort of part of what you brought to the situation, what made you decide to sign up?


Well again, it's self-preservation. I have a healthy sense of my own importance. I have a healthy sense of making sure that I do the best by myself. I'm not going to stand there and let the faculty just take it away, heavens no. This is a step for me to have a voice. I will take it.


So, do you remember hearing about the you know, the rest of the process, the application to the Ontario Labour Relations board, you know, what do you remember sort of happening?


It was actually very exciting. It was. It was very heady things. Because for a certain amount of time, you know, the administration was watching and everybody was wondering who was going through, was it going to be with CUPE, was it going to be the staff association? And of course, I was in the thick of it as a staff rep. Yeah, I have to admit it was a little bit exciting and heady for a young person. And there were definite militants who were there, who would have probably called for a strike then and there at that first, you know, as the drive ended and you signed up, then you have to go for your first collective agreement. And that was going I think rather poorly at the beginning, so there was a lot of calls by the young Turks for more militant stance. And okay. You know, I don't believe we ever struck while I was there.


Because when did you leave the university?


In 76. I kind of remember hearing that they had decertified at a certain point, or is that not correct. Or did they go to CUPE? They went to CUPE. Okay.


Yeah. In the early 80s.


Oh, okay. So in other, but they did go on strike at a certain point.


Yes. Just after they joined CUPE.


There we go. See? I'm vindicated.


So were you, did you leave before or after the first collective agreement was reached?


I believe I left after the first collective agreement. I would have left in the spring of 7-



Content

76.

And that's actually when certification came.

Certification? Oh.

Yeah. The faculty certified in 1975 I think in June, and CUSSA, the Carleton University Support Staff Association, certified like in March.

Okay well then it would have certified, I would have left probably around June. It was in the summer that I left.

And so you don't remember, whether or not any sort of impact from that first collective agreement. Like you don't, can you remember getting a pay increase, or      r benefits, or?

I can't remember, no, so quite possibly it hadn't gone through. It wasn't why I left though.

Oh, and what made you decide to leave?

Oh, it was just basically wanting to try a different place. Going away from home. You know I had already moved out of my mother's home, but I just sort of wanted to move away. And so I could've gone to Toronto where I had a sister, or I could've gone to Kitchener-Waterloo where I had a sister, and I chose Kitchener-Waterloo. And in fact I wrote ahead to the university there, Laurier, and said do you have a position? And when I arrived I actually took a sort of an interim job through one of these part time employment agencies. I didn't really like that part time kind of work on spec. And so I did call up the university and said, well Iï¿½m here, I'd like an interview, and I did get hired right away.

Okay. And which department were you hired into?

Actually I tried out for the university proper in their OSAP area. Where they did student loans. And apparently I was way overqualified for that job. And so I got the news that Iï¿½d been turned down for that position but then they said, well there is a position at Waterloo Seminary, which is the founding theological seminary of Laurier. They're actually having their hundredth anniversary this year. And they said, would you like to try out for that position, and I said sure. So I went over, was interviewed, and had the job the same day.

Oh okay. And what did you do at the seminary?

I started off as a support staff. Basically again in a small office, and then I became the administrative assistant to the principal dean a few years later.

Yeah, yeah, interesting.

Stayed there for 30 years.

So is there anything else about that whole process, now were you unionized when you went to Laurier?

Did you end up being in a unionized?

Well actually, that process started many many years later at Laurier. And at the time that it began, the seminary staff and the university staff were all part of the same staff association. Always had been. And we were considered in some sense to be university staff although we were hired separately by the seminary. And so there when the university unionized their staff, there was a bit of a kerfuffle. They wanted the seminary staff included, but the seminary had its own board of governors, had its own senate, had its own setup, had its own budget, had its own funding. And so it was deemed, that went all the way to the labour board and it was deemed no, they would be considered a separate employer by virtue of that fact. So we were excluded. They wanted to fight it and our staff said you know it's not really worth your while, we'll just part ways. So at that point then we went through the drive, but after the drive and after we had signed up, we were excluded by the labour board.

Oh okay. Getting back to Carleton, what was the role of the staff association when you were a rep in it? Like what did you see that association as providing for people?

Well part of it of course early on was that probably was the social agency. But it was beginning to become more politically active. And probably because of the inclusion of the younger, more professional workers. I think that they had a different vision than, you know, perhaps the departmental secretaries who'd been there. And it's not to say that Harriet Abbott and Eleanor Currie, who were both working women, didn't consider a voice for staff to admin to be important, it's just they probably were not as militant in their attitude in terms of what they expected the staff association to do on their behalf.

Yeah. And do you remember anybody sort of talking against unionization around you, like do you remember any of?

Oh yea, I mean the big fear of course was that we would go on strike. And that's always a difficult thing.

Gosh I was just speaking to our letter carrier, my sister was the other day. And of course Deanna's husband went out on strike with his company. You don't recover necessarily. You don't and the staff at Laurier went out for almost half a year. It was terrible. The loss of money to the staff, but also the bitterness. They're just getting over it now and it's been like 5 years. And they're coming up now, they may strike again. So I think that when you look at unionization and the very real fear that there's going to be a strike, that can destroy the fabric of community that's important I think on a university campus. The community that links staff, faculty, students and admin. It's pretty tenuous anyway because they have conflicting needs.

Tell me a little bit about that. Tell me a little bit about this idea of community. When you use that word what does it sort of mean to you?

Well of course when I worked at Laurier with the seminary, that was a huge word of importance because when you have community, you have different groups of people with different goals. But if you do not have a sense of respect for the other persons, if you don't have a means of communicating with those people beyond the goals, basically what happens then is the goals become paramount and you're not able to give a little, give to the other person and take, and step back and maybe let a negotiation work. It's my way or the highway. And when you have different groups, someone's going to get stepped on. And I fear that usually it's the weakest link. And usually that's staff.

And why is that? Why are they the weakest link?

They have the least power. On a university campus, power is defined by rank. You have the faculty who go through their chairs to their senates, to the university, to the government. And it is defined by money, it is defined on allocation of funds, it is defined on basis of what money will go where, and it's not the staff who are going to make those decisions, ever. And I think that sometimes it's done on the basis of practicality, sometimes it's done on the basis of politics.

So, community, if there's a sense of community, what does that look like if that's working well, or if that's there?

Well normally for instance, when the staff went on strike, the faculty who were also unionized, supported them. 100% throughout the whole process. It got very ugly at times with the administration and I think that if the faculty had not supported the staff, the students of course were getting necessarily upset. But without that community spirit, between the faculty and the staff, it, well the university, the strike may have ended a lot earlier but I think that the staff probably would have suffered in the long run because they would have felt that you know, you can't even trust the people you're working with to back you up. Staff and faculty work together on a day by day basis. Far moreso than students and faculty or students and staff. And so I think that probably in terms of community, the staff-faculty relationship is the most important. Because I worked for a small college, the administration was also faculty. And so there was a much more of an integral circle I would say of staff, students, faculty, and admin. On a university campus I would say the community has to probably come more in terms of faculty and staff. Not sure about librarians. I would have thought librarians would have been with the faculty as professionals, even though they started off I believe with the staff. I would have seen their goals more in line with faculty.

So is community about getting along, or is it just about being in the same geographic area, like is it, you know?

I think community has more to do with respect for the other person's role, respect for the work that they do and contribution that they do. Because there are some people who basically divorce the people from the work that's being done. And so you become basically an object. You can be simply be replaced. So you have human resources, right? You don't have      , who's the chair secretary, you have a position that can be filled by basically anybody. And if you don't have a respect for the people who are working and the work that they do, then you know, it's basically in some sense staff, dumb broads doing dumb broad work. You could bring in anybody off the street and office work could be done. And that's just ridiculous. Same as, Oh, anybody could to a library work, isn't it just taking out a book and putting it back on the shelf? No, it's not, of course not. So faculty also have to have respect for the role of the librarian in the whole academic experience. Just as really I think they need to have respect for the students.

In the process. I've worked with faculty who have basically said, Yeah, Yeah, I read the paper, gave it an A. And I thought, well that's showing no respect to the student. Take the time, read the paper, and if the student has actually put some work into it, let them know that you've read it. Don't just dismiss it and say, yeah I've read the paper and done my job. No you haven't. You know. Include the student in that circle of community too. So for me community has a lot to do with respect, has a lot to do with honouring the other person's work. Has a lot to do with good manners. Simple good manners.

Just getting back to sort of the unionization. So were you, was there any, did, were you aware of what was happening for faculty as they were certifying, was that?

Not a great deal. I think that they were much more politically active and at the same time I think that they were, from the rumblings that I heard just a bit, very concerned about their professional role. That is, do professionals unionize? And what is the role of a professional in unionization? And that was reflected later on so I may be at Laurier, so I may be extrapolating some of that. But it's a slight line that you have to balance. Am I a union member, a worker, or am I a professional and I therefore am part of a different class of person?

So, this was something that Professor Frumhart never talked about.

Oh no, but then he didn't talk about personal things of that nature per se. He was far more concerned about academics.

So is there, is there anything else about the process or that time that you think is important to mention?

The only thing that I really remember at that point was that there was a great deal of ugliness, and as I say again, good manners tended to fall by the wayside. And it was a bit of a shock.

Did that happen to you personally?

No I wouldn't say, except for the fact that of course my position was one of the ones that they deemed not to be part of the union and that was of course challenged, because I had no access to staff records. I didn't oversee any staff. I simply had faculty records which was quite different.

So did your position end up being included? Okay.

As far as I know.

Okay. So how were you aware of the ugliness, was it happening to other people?

Yes. I think people were reporting that pressure was being put on them. And I don't know in what way.

You mean from-

Just from the admin. I don't believe from the faculty, I don't believe I ever heard the faculty say anything other than, you know, good for you, go ahead, yeah.

But there was this sense that for other people, there was pressure.

Yes. Perhaps from the admin, like our admin area, I'm not sure.

So when you use admin, do you mean like the president and the vice presidents or?

Oh I mean in our area, I mean more like Mary Jones. She would be admin. I'm not sure where Mary Jones, whether she was even there at that point or how...

So not much the senior administration but more if you were in a group.

Or HR, that kind of area.

Okay, thank you, that is just great, oh yeah


Movement was certainly on. I have never burned a bra. I'm, I won't tell you what size I am but that would not have been good. I don't know that feminist thought reached down to the secretarial staff at that point. I think it really was beginning to make headway for the professional women coming through. Certainly the women who were on faculty and later on the people who I knew at Laurier who were librarians or who were in the more senior levels of administration, began to see their role not simply as staff or librarian or so forth but as women who had a particular contribution to make on behalf of other women who were coming behind. I have never actually seen that as something that was important to me personally. But I've always been of the opinion that for staff people, at whatever level, union level, whether they're custodians, if they're doing it at as professionals, then that is what I would applaud. Whether they're men or whether they are women. And I'm not really certain that I like to put women forward above men. I think that they should be put forward equally, and to some extent, certainly in some professions now, it's gone the whole other way, that a woman's perspective now becomes to define the field. Like social work is one of them. And I think that that loses something. I think gender shouldn't be neutral, but there should be a good mix in order to have the gifts of both men and women represented.

So you, when you were for example, starting at Carleton, you mentioned that your first wage was not enough to live on. Did you ever connect that with being female and the work you did?

Oh certainly. I understood that there were certain positions that were not going to be paid as well because they were deemed not to be as important in society. They were more service-oriented. And I think anything that's more service-oriented if it's not unionized probably has that discrimination factor. It didn't deter me any, when I was going through my grade 13, I told one of my teachers that I was going to be going to business college and he said that he was very disappointed, he had felt that I would be a professional. And I was sort of thinking, well, a professional what? Even then, in high school, I was thinking, a professional what? I can be a professional of anything that I wish. It just doesn't mean that I'll necessarily be paid huge wages. But I never could

Figure out something that I wanted to be that was going to be well paid that I wanted to do. Didn't want to be a librarian, didn't want to be a teacher, didn't want to be a doctor or a nurse. I always loved being a secretary, so you know. One thing about gender neutrality or having a good mix, the only thing that really affected at Carleton for me was that I got to be on the curling team. Because they had an inter-departmental curling team. And in order for it to be inter-departmental you had to have a mix of men and women. So I got to be on the sociology curling team which was a lot of fun. Because not only was I on the curling team, but afterwards, we always went out to the Preston Hotel. And had a few pints there afterwards. Which I never told my mother of course, because she was very

Religious. It was fun.

Okay. Am I on? So now we're talking about sexual harassment and yes it did exist. But at that time we didn't know it was sexual harassment. We just thought, oh well, you know, it's what happens. So you would be you know, just talking, even to the departmental secretary, and one of the faculty members would come up and just give you a real big pinch on your rear end. And you'd go, Whoa! And he thought that was really funny. And even Eleanor kind of went, uhh, you know, but didn't say anything, because what did you say, it was all in fun, right? We didn't exactly appreciate it. I didn't appreciate it. And then at one point too, one of the support staff, who was very traditional. And as I had mentioned earlier, we were asked by the faculty, we were told by the faculty that we were doing their academic typing. In this one particular case, she ended up having to do personal typing, not for the academic faculty person, but for his wife. And it was poetry. Now, she, we were in this little small area together. So she said, I can't do this, I can't type this, this is lewd, this is terrible I'm so upset. So I don't know if she continued typing it. She certainly complained and I think it ended up being done, but she told us some of the poetry and it was basically of a very sexual, frank nature. Such that somebody who was typing, who was a very traditional, Roman Catholic Italian background, found it offensive. But we had no recourse to say no. And it wasn't even academic work. It had nothing to do with the academic work of the department. But it just happened to be that a faculty member wanted it typed. And so you did it. And I would say nowadays, that's sexual harassment, that's inappropriate. But at that point you had no recourse, and if you would say anything about it, it would be kind of like, they'd just look back at you and just say suck it up, suck it up.
